                <h1>About Spotify</h1>
                <p>
                    Spotify is a digital music, podcast, and video service that gives you access to millions 
                    of songs and other content from creators all over the world. Basic functions such as playing 
                    music are totally free, but you can also choose to upgrade to Spotify Premium. Whether you have 
                    Premium or not, you can: get recommendations based on your taste, build collections of music and 
                    podcasts and more! Spotify is available across a range of devices, including computers, phones, 
                    tablets, speakers, TVs, and cars, and you can easily transition from one to another with Spotify 
                    Connect.<br><br>
                    In 2013, the call of innovation also drew us at the DL Group to introduce purple tea
                    at Koisagat Tea Estate. We learnt about it from Kenya’s Tea Research Foundation and 
                    didn’t waste time in planting it on about 100 acres. In doing so, we became one of the
                    first Kenyan companies to start planting and eventually processing purple tea. We did
                    this with one eye on the European and Chinese markets where purple tea is quite popular.
                    <br><br>
                    In real estate, the DL Group’s embrace of business innovation ensured that it was among 
                    the pioneers of the shopping mall concept in Mombasa. The Group’s Nyali Mall has now become 
                    a centre of both social and business life in Mombasa. Built on an area of over 330,000 square 
                    feet, the Centre offers spacious offices, shop premises, supermarkets, popular restaurants, 
                    showrooms and much more. Indeed, it exemplifies the DL Group’s focus on world class excellence. 
                    Such is the spirit that runs through all of DL Groups Companies in the different sectors where it 
                    operates.
                    <br><br>
                    We have created direct, full time employment for at least 4,000 people mostly in Kenya and Tanzania, 
                    but also several other countries in Asia and Europe. Although both Kenya and Tanzania have formal 
                    unemployment rates of below fifteen percent, a good percentage of people with jobs are underemployed 
                    in terms of low pay that is barely sufficient to meet their needs. Against this backdrop, we have been 
                    able to make a sizable dent in the unemployment scene in these two countries. We are also contributing 
                    to the livelihoods of thousands more since they are part of our value chains across the region.
